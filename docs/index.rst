  The GooseEYE package is relies on the components below. Each have proved to be extremely attractive from an implementation side, and are therefore worth mentioning on the landing page.

  * All implementation is in C++, relying mostly on `cppmat <http://cppmat.geus.me>`_ as back-end.

  * The Python interface is generated using `pybind11 <http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_. This project is particularly worth mentioning as it is extremely easy to use, and requires almost no code.

  * The GUI is build using `Qt <https://www.qt.io>`_ which is completely free professional platform, that even comes with a graphical design tool: Qt Creator.

  * The plotting in the GUI is done using `QCustomPlot <http://qcustomplot.com>`_ with which professional plots, including PDF exports, can be effortlessly made in a Qt application.

  * The code itself is freely hosted on the well-know platform `GitHub <http://www.github.com>`_.

  * The documentation, that you are reading right now, is freely hosted by `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_.
